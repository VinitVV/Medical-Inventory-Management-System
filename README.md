# Medical-Inventory-Management-System
In today's world, the availability and management of medicines play a crucial role in healthcare. To ensure effective operations, a well-organized application is needed. This project introduces a desktop application designed for medical stores, enabling administrators to efficiently track and manage various aspects. The application maintains a comprehensive medical inventory database, including employee information, company details, customer records, and medicine stocks. The administrator has the authority to make purchases from different companies, update medicine information, and record sales transactions. Customers are identified by unique IDs and can purchase medicines from the store. The application provides flexibility for the administrator to add, edit, or delete records as required, empowering efficient management of the medical store's activities.
